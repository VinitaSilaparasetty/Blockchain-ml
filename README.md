Combining Blockchain and Machine Learning for Fraud Detection.

This project is based on my conference presentation "Machine Learning and Blockchain for Fraud Detection: Employing Artificial Intelligence in the Banking Sector Machine Learning and Blockchain for Fraud Detection: Employing Artificial Intelligence in the Banking Sector".

Using Python demonstrate how an XGBoosted K-means algorithm can be combined with a simple blockchain in order to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. 
The intended use case for this project is in the Banking Sector.
